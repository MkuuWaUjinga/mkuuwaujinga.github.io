C'est moi

Hi there, I am Adrian :wave:.

I am currently doing my Masters in computer science and mathematics at
TUM and an honors in technology management at CDTM.

My goal is to contribute towards a future where artificial intelligence
turned out as good for humanity. This drives my interest in research and
product management.
As a researcher, I am interested in data-efficient learning,
representation learning and new learning paradigms such as
self-supervision or causal inference. Progress in these fields would
open up doors to new application areas where (labelled) data is hard to
obtain.
I am also intrigued by interpretable, robust and fair machine learning.

Check out some recent projects of mine applying self-supervised learning
in computer vision
<https://github.com/MkuuWaUjinga/Self-Supervised-Learning-for-Tracktor>
or reinforcement learning <https://github.com/MkuuWaUjinga/DeepMDP-SSL4RL>.
Recently, I also started contributing to Garage
<https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage> to make reinforcement learning
more reproducible.
During my time at HPI, I built an exploration software
<https://github.com/meta-exp> for knowledge graphs and a window manager
<https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/WindowAcrobatics> for the Squeak VM.

I like to go running and to cycle in my free time :runner:. The day I
figure out how to swim fast enough, I might try a triathlon. Playing the
piano is a form of meditation for me :notes:.


      Add product management section

Product management of consumer facing intelligent products. There is a
lot more product management has to do when the product is intelligent.
For instance data collections that excludes unwanted biases.

Ultimatively humans won’t interact with intelligent algorithms but with
products exposing them. Thus I am really intereste in product managmenet and
