Hi there, I am Adrian :wave:.

My goal is to contribute towards a future where artificial intelligence turns out as good for humanity.
This drives my interest in research and product management. 

As a researcher, I am interested in data-efficient learning, representation learning and new learning paradigms such as self-supervision or causal inference. 
I am also intrigued by interpretable, robust and fair machine learning. 

As a product manager, I want to build inclusive and useful [machine learning experiences](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/803/).
I am also interested in learning how to manage cutting-edge research projects in a way that they are more product-focused and have a clear emphasis on impact.

Feel free to check out some recent projects applying self-supervised learning in [computer vision (CVPR 2022 full paper)](https://github.com/MkuuWaUjinga/leopart) or [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/MkuuWaUjinga/DeepMDP-SSL4RL).

I like to go running and cycling in my free time :runner:. The day I figure out how to swim fast enough, I might go for a triathlon.
