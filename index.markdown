Hi there, I am Adrian :wave:.

I am currently doing my Masters in computer science and mathematics at TUM and an honors in technology management at CDTM. 

My goal is to contribute towards a future where artificial intelligence turns out as good for humanity.
This drives my interest in research and product management. 

As a researcher, I am interested in data-efficient learning, representation learning and new learning paradigms such as self-supervision or causal inference. 
Progress in these fields would open up doors to many new application areas where (labelled) data is hard to obtain. I am also intrigued by interpretable, robust and fair machine learning. 

As a product manager, I want to build inclusive and useful [machine learning experiences](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/803/).
I am also interested in learning how to manage cutting-edge research projects in a way that they are more product-focused and have a clear emphasis on impact.

Feel free to check out some recent projects of mine applying self-supervised learning in [computer vision](https://github.com/MkuuWaUjinga/Self-Supervised-Learning-for-Tracktor) or [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/MkuuWaUjinga/DeepMDP-SSL4RL).
Recently, I also started contributing to [Garage](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage) to make reinforcement learning more reproducible. 

I like to go running and cycling in my free time :runner:. The day I figure out how to swim fast enough, I might go for a triathlon.
I enjoy playing the piano and perceive it as deeply relaxing :notes:.
